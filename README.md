This project aims to solve the problem of LLM unreliability by replacing the reasoning with machine learning algorithms while retaining the natural language processing element that LLMs excel at. This is done through the context of caffeine drink recommendation.

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/georgp23/llm-ml-caffeine-assistant.git
cd llm-ml-caffeine-assistant
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Setup environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following content:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
